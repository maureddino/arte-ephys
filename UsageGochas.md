## Rough listing of problems that can come up in usage ##

### Prob 1 ###
Arte freezes on start, or on crash, right after a previous use.  I terminated it with Ctrl+.
### Solution ###
Restart the computer.  Aborting arte without the right stop sequence to the DAQ cards can cause it to hang next time it runs.
