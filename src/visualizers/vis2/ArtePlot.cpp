// Each plot needs to update its children axes when its redraw gets called. it also needs to call the parent plot
// when children axes get added it should place them in the correct location because it KNOWS where WAVE1 and PROJ1x3
// should go by default. This isn't as general as it should be but its a good push in the right direction
