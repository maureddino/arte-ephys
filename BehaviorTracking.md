# Proposals #

  * Digital camera, usb.
  * Kinect
  * Analog camera, frame grabber

# Pros & Cons #

  * Digital camera
    * Probably has standardized interface?  Could work with web cams many years into future?
    * Cheap
    * 
    * No panning, no depth.  Not sure about sensitivity in IR for LED tracking.

  * Analog cam & frame grabber
    * Similar to AD setup currently in use
    * Probably standardized interface to frame grabber?  Not sure.
    * 
    * No panning, depth

  * X-box Kinect
    * Open source drivers.  Active (but young) hacking community, how-to's
    * Depth information.  Object identification & tracking?
    * Panning, zoom.
    * IR sensitive (how it does the depth)
    * 
    * May not be around forever
    * Will IR LED's mess up the depth calculation?  Can we still use IR LED's?
    * May encourage us to embed functionality in our output data that's hard to get from other systems.

Still in the googleing for info phase.
