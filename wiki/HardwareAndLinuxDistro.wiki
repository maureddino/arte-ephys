#summary An overview of the hardware, linux distro, and basic drivers in the base system

= Introduction =

The base system is a reasonably modern desktop computer with multiple PCI slots, a NIDaq acquisition card (NI-6254), and an nVidia graphics card (GeForce 7300?).

The OS is CentOS 5.4 (?), non-PAE

Nvidia drivers (in rpmforge repo) will be needed for the graphics card, and the NI card(s) is/are driven with the NIDaqmx driver (link).

A number of additionall development libraries need to be installed to build ArtE.  Most of these are in the rpmforge repo, but some are not.

= Details =

* Desktop *
Our test machine:
-spec 1 (processor, link to newegg?)
-spec 2 (mobo, link to newegg?)
-spec 3

* NI-6254 *
-drivers link

* GeForce 7300 (?) *
-link to nvidia product page
-link to driver rpm (in case it leaves the repo?)

* Additional libraries *
libXt-devel (and dependencies)
plotutils-devel (and dependencies)
gtk+-devel (... and dependencies for all the following...)
gcc-c++
libXaw-devel
libpng-devel
gtk2-devel  (this should also pull down atk, pango, cairo)
mesa-libGLU-devel
LINK to gtkglext-1.2.0 - instructions for how to configure and build
gtkmm2-devel
cairomm-devel
gtkmm4-devel

(this is the list of packages installed by yum on the test computer.  Of course the building gtkmm24 code would probably work with some omissions, but I haven't tested this yet.  Let's not pare this list down until we test the proposed new list on a fresh machine).
