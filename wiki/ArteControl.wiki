#summary Discussion: Network control app for arte
#labels Network,Interface,Headless

= Details =

Please give feedback!  I haven't read much about network programming.

The idea: arte acquisition will be entirely headless.  All UI will happen through UDP or TCP commands.

Is this the right idea, below?
The process running the program 'arte-control' will be the server, and all setup processes and display processes will be clients.

A TCP socket on server port A will wait for connection requests from clients.  Port number A will be hard-coded in the headers of arte-control, arte, and arte-display?

UDP port B will be for passing spike/eeg data from arte client to arte-display client.

Plz edit this page heavily, adding links to relevant sites, and code snippets demonstrating how to set up these 'listening' and 'talking' ports.  This is a little bit of a sticking point for my thinking about where/when to load initialization files, etc.

Thanks!
