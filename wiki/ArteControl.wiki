For accepting text commands over the network, ArtE backend binds a single socket and listens to it continuously on a (detached?) thread.  backend/process_command includes arteopt.h (and indirectly trode.h and lfp_bank.h; we also declare extern trode_array and extern lfp_bank_array).  So process_command can call trode methods, changing thresholds, etc.
