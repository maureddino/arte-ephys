We'll use the PCI-CTR05 counter card in machines needing to count the clock signal other than the backend (computer running tracker, for example).

The hope is that this card can be used more easily than the national instruments cards under Ubuntu.  (We don't want the tracker running under CentOS like the backend b/c we're limited to less fancy libraries under CentOS).

A driver can be found here
ftp://lx10.tx.ncsu.edu/pub/Linux/drivers

Also pick up 60-mcc.rules from there.  Read the readme file carefully.  I'm going to try to install it on my workstation presently..
