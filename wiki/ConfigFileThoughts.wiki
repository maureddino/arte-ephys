#summary How should we implement configuration for recording sessions?
#labels Configuration,PropertyTree

= Introduction =

There's a lot of state to save between sessions:

 ==Session settings constant within rat==
  * channel -> trode assignment
  * trode filter settings
  * channel gains
  * channel thresholds
  * channel colors
  * channel 'cursors' (ie a little marker in amplitude space for vis only)
  * (potentially) cluster bounds for closed-loop stuff
  * channel -> eeg assignment
  * eeg stacking order
  * eeg trace color
  * eeg filter settings

 ==Settings that may change within day, at user's whim ==
  * Trode -> display window assignment
  * Trode magnification
  * Ordering displayed trodes within a window
  * Show/hide metadata 

 ==Back-end settings probably essentially constant over life of the system ==
  * pin_in -> channel assignments
  * Daq input buffer sizes
  * Rules for default output file names

 ==One-off, single-day or dubugging mode==
  * Get input from card, or from saved card buffer dump series?
  * No displays?

How can we implement all this?

=Proposal=

2 config files, each in 2 possible places

 * arte_backend.conf
 * arte_session.conf

Parse them using [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/doc/html/property_tree.html Boost Property Tree]

Then hopefully we can write to xml, too, when the tree changes due to user input.
