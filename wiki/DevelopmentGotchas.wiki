==Rough listing of problems that come up when coding, and solutions in some cases==


===Prob 1 ===
Programs that try to operate on big arte data files segfault, while they work on smaller files.
===Solution===
Sln: compile with this flag: {{{-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64}}}  This seems to work sometimes even when the define line (#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64) doesn't work.  See build.sh for arte_to_tt for example.

===Prob 2===
My thing that includes global_defs.h won't build, it complains about UINT16_MAX being not declared.

=== Solution === 
they're declared in <stdint.h> but only if you pass this flag to gcc:  {{{-D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS}}}   (see build.sh for arte, or for arte_to_tt, for an example).

===Prob 3===
Trying to simultaneously use the analog in lines and a counter line, you get daqmx error num: -89137 with message: Specified route cannot be satisfied, because it requires resources that are currently in use by another route.  /  Property: DAQmx_RefClk_Src  /  Source Device: Dev1  /  Source Terminal: 10MHzRefClock  /  Required Resources in Use by  /  Task Name: Counter Task / Source Device: Dev1 / Source Terminal: None /  Destination Device: Dev1  /  Destination Terminal: RefClock / Task Name: Dev1 / Status Code: -89137
===Solution===
The clock source of the counter must be explicitly set to match that on the analog in lines.  Add this before starting the counter task:    daq_err_check( DAQmxSetRefClkSrc( counterTask, "OnboardClock") );
